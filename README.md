This is my prefered vim configuration file based on experimenting with python development and general use.

For Windows 10:
> Link .vimrc to %UserProfile%/_vimrc
> Link vimfiles to $UserProfile%/.vim
> Link .gvimrc to %UserProfile%/.gvimrc

For Unix:
> Replace %UserProfile% with ~ above

Always happy for feedback an suggestions.
